## Durable notes (added by assistant)
- User preference: For complex/real-world questions, always search/research and verify before answering; slower is fine.
- User preference: In Telegram replies, do not use markdown tables; use lists/plain text.
- User preference: Use latest current date context when answering time-sensitive questions.
- User preference: Use available tools/MCPs early (especially image understanding when image tasks are involved).
- Workflow preference: For complex coding/product tasks, start with plan+research and create a PLAN.md to stabilize cross-model handoff.

## Work completed

  - Installed/configured MCP servers for `rednote` and `weibo` via mcporter config.
